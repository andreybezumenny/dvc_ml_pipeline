0,Updates to proc cpuinfo are long overdue and I m asking you to reconsider your objections I more than appreciate that there is information that people want access to and I d really like to expose that in a consistent and structured manner So please propose exposing the information elsewhere which I would be more than happy with for information that the kernel already has access to I object to proc cpuinfo changes because they impose an ABI break and because some of the proposed changes impose new and requirements on the kernel that cannot be maintained in a forwards compatible manner which is liable to result in other ABI breaks For better or worse we re stuck with the existing arch specific format of proc cpuinfo as this is parsed by a wide variety of applications and any change risks breaking these We re willing to work with distro vendors to get this information added to their products while upstream is left behind but I hope that won t be necessary Please understand that this is an ABI break and that is why it is being NAK d I don t have the power to stop Red Hat or other vendors from deliberately breaking ABI but I would very strongly recommend that they do not I would even go so far as to say that we should be making proc cpuinfo for ARM match the x86 output as closely as possible As has been stated before proc cpuinfo is an existing arch specific ABI For better or worse we re stuck with it as is regardless of what could be nicer had we done something different from the outset It has never been portable across architectures and applications relying upon it have never been portable except by chance even using their terminology
