Updates to proc cpuinfo are long overdue and I m asking you to reconsider your objections I more than appreciate that there is information that people want access to and I d really like to expose that in a consistent and structured manner So please propose exposing the information elsewhere which I would be more than happy with for information that the kernel already has access to I object to proc cpuinfo changes because they impose an ABI break and because some of the proposed changes impose new and requirements on the kernel that cannot be maintained in a forwards compatible manner which is liable to result in other ABI breaks For better or worse we re stuck with the existing arch specific format of proc cpuinfo as this is parsed by a wide variety of applications and any change risks breaking these We re willing to work with distro vendors to get this information added to their products while upstream is left behind but I hope that won t be necessary Please understand that this is an ABI break and that is why it is being NAK d I don t have the power to stop Red Hat or other vendors from deliberately breaking ABI but I would very strongly recommend that they do not I would even go so far as to say that we should be making proc cpuinfo for ARM match the x86 output as closely as possible As has been stated before proc cpuinfo is an existing arch specific ABI For better or worse we re stuck with it as is regardless of what could be nicer had we done something different from the outset It has never been portable across architectures and applications relying upon it have never been portable except by chance even using their terminology

Although I assume the middle layer and driver can treat that as a separate case so if it s not suitable to use pm_runtime_force for that case then they shouldn t do it Well agreed In some simple cases though driver callbacks can be reused for hibernation too so it would be good to have a common way to do that too IMO Okay that makes sense Also quite so often other middle layers interact with PCI directly or indirectly eg a platform device may be a child or a consumer of a PCI device and some optimizations need to take that into account eg parents generally need to be accessible when their childres are resumed and so on A device s parent becomes informed when changing the runtime PM status of the device via pm_runtime_force_suspend resume as those calls pm_runtime_set_suspended active This requires the parent driver or middle layer to look at the reference counter and understand it the same way as pm_runtime_force_ In case that isn t that sufficient what else is needed
