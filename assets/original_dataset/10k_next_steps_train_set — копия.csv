1,And you have to do
1,We're gonna need to put in a really good battery city will have to charge
1,And and then after that we'll have to make some decisions
1,We should definite boards the big square block i just brought
1,"i'm gonna have to address the cause six years 'cause"" or wherever time so um"""
1,i'm then i'm gonna have to specify the final design In the final report
1,We're gonna discuss the the look-and-feel design user interface design and We're gonna evaluate the product
1,alright so the way this works so i'm going to plug in the powerpoint I'm trying to this quick as possible
1,Uh i'll open a t. v. d.
1,So when we scroll we need to some way to get the t. v. to respond
1,First thing we have to do is come up with um
1,You need to discuss
1,So the reason we're here we're gonna design a new remote control as you probably all know
1,some kind of market facility because you have to programme that you have to have a lot of response back or at least some kinda
1,We're needing find have to figure out
1,We have to decide exactly what we're gonna do for a remote before we leave this meeting and be best to save this is what we're going this is the design we're gonna try and get this is how we're gonna make uh software unique
1,My only that we should definitely going for a user focus design
1,Not on the desktop you're fine you should find that there's a project documents Link
1,so we need to make sure that even with the joystick Yes and we can just sit comfortably in the palm of the hand I have to trust it just corpus um
1,We have to sell at least
1,So we should just look at uh at the speaker but the speaker and an l. e. d.
1,You have to use rubber buttons as well
1,For a while for a slightly more should buy more for for my a bit more ergonomic as well
1,Yeah we gotta find a it's
1,And then we will
1,Suppose you have to go to t. v. in
1,Well and which we will do very very shortly
1,But also to we need to decide on us how we're gonna go from here
1,we're gonna have to stick with these figures
1,Get rid of the whole okay to locator fine
1,Oh so should go for the case
1,Good to go down a great to to fall we have to do
1,Yeah the the budget and uh we have to cut almost uh-huh
1,then we'll go
1,Talk for a project plan
1,Discuss our own ideas everything
1,We have to buy one
1,I am right okay we've got half an hour the for the next meeting so we're gonna go off and your individual things
1,Corporate image should be incorporated in a remote control
1,It's going to be on on tuesdays at ten o'clock
1,It's a kind of yeah and i'll put that into your laptop then it's nice to tell you should make it like a plastic nice to hold in the palm of the hand
1,I'm going to look at the functional requirements and the marketing point of view
1,We need to focus on that as well
1,It's gonna be the same so we need to focus on just one thing not get bored and and lots of different um
1,But we should focus on making the manual is user-friendly as possible because a lot of them are just Tiny little right and lots and lots of pages
1,We have to press o. f. eight
1,I'll go over what we decided last Meeting
1,Well we need to think about how it's gonna look different
1,Consultants in paris and milan who did attended all the design in fashion fears and The fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes shoes and furniture so should we be thinking of using something like that in a remote control to find see
1,But we need to make a decision
1,we'll just put in this will put in this half
1,So we're going to look at d. screen
1,as we should invite your presentation with all the other
1,That people have to keep line
1,The lower will be done some of them
1,"being as a marketing 'cause"" the expert and then like to say like before deciding the cost of this remote control or the end of the things we must see the market potential for this product like what is the competition in the market were to have the available prices of the of the remote controls in the prices white space or do our own remote controls are having"""
1,Only dollar remote controls i've used you should come with the television
1,And as you say we need to have some kind of gimmick so
1,We should all look into a bit
1,Seventy five percent of users they do find it that the remote control so whatever in the market are are really they're not so we're looking so we have to put stress on this uh we have to take care of this vector also like Our design uh should be appropriate should be good looking
1,as we have decided in the last meeting that i have to find out
1,so we have to decide need on which functions are going to actually have
1,Uh-huh need to plug yeah
1,So We should look at
1,we're gonna design caving in such a way like half of what we need not to have a full colour we will just have a half of colour okay
1,"I'd we're gonna have a big banana shaped remote control 'cause"" yellow"""
1,Fancy chips we need to buy
1,Is uh we're gonna take a look at some old remote controls see how they work
1,And the shape they will just make it kind of mixed and matched type shape or
1,And then we'll colour for the buttons
1,No well We have uh our next meeting in half an hour
1,We will put up a shape casing on that you do your apple-shaped look so in that they
1,So there so the findings so we need to combine those ones
1,We really need really gonna need to hold it
1,Then we should start with
1,In this meeting i i'm going to discuss what the trend watching
1,So we have to look on this
1,We should do
1,So they should also taken into consideration
1,I guess there are a lot of options are gonna have to choose from one
1,And then we'll throw in our new innovations
1,Right so this is what we need to have For certain
1,Sorry necessary at the outer casing which you have to decide you know what's gonna be
1,On the board we have to use b. c.
1,And they have to pick it up and then activate and then yeah
1,and further instructions will be sent by your personal coaches
1,The you know we are currently going to produce minus the extra scroll buttons
1,And or forgotten familiar the minutes but i will do
1,Uh yeah well yeah we have to match left and so
1,Something we should fit

1,Um i'll put the minutes in that project documents folder but i'll send you an email wanna do it so that you know it should be on your desktop
1,We need to buy the end of the meeting come to some kind of decision on
1,After lunch we go back to our own
1,And then i'll send them to you after the meeting
1,So we need to do a with that functionality of the remote control
1,And then we've got a lunch break
1,Before lunch we just have to complete a questionnaire and some sort of summary
1,Then we need to briefly discuss the new project requirements that was sent to the side just saying
1,What we have to do now is to go back to our little places complete a questionnaire and some sort of
1,I'll do that next time
1,So we need to it yeah we need to have a clearly defined group
1,Okay so we need to unplug
1,Certainly yeah so so that uh yeah well we definitely need to operate within the constraint
1,Well it's not quite so essential part we'll do it in this town we can do it
1,I'm just gonna go to
1,But we still need to think about the colour of a remote as such you know just keep black or
1,the user interface designer will work on the in the user interface design
1,Going on working individually and then coming back to a meeting that
1,and then we will have a brief evaluation of the whole process of
1,What we have to get through in this meeting it is Firstly The prototype presentation for me too So you can shows what you've been working on
1,Right so we have to complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary when a
1,And seven is no you really doesn't we need to get back and start again
1,so what michael will explain you are user interface there
1,"Then i need to say since Few things about finance 'cause"" we have to check that"""
1,i'm gonna give a seven and everything so that the
1,Now we have to calculate the production cost
1,Of course is a provisional so we have to go down
1,But i guess by the end of this meeting we should have at least uh
1,We should have a backup plan or just a a really good television remote control
1,"I'll put 'em"" in your pocket"""
1,But you have to see the movie for a appreciate it
1,the chip will be controlled by the user interface
1,Oh i'm gonna draw it on them for them
1,We should just go with the simplest
1,Yeah why should we will buy this one level you got a remote that kind of that serious
1,And uh some sort of you will have a lot a lot but my connection or or a cover or something like that I guess that's the point where we need to decide about that
1,Well i that's what we're gonna aim To get together by the next meeting then
1,I'm gonna write that down
1,Gabriel you're gonna be working on you know
1,We will come again yeah it's got a film uh she's gonna look cool um and it's
1,And see you will be worked on the product evaluation
1,And we have to do it on a scale of one to seven one being true so it's it it's more like it's fits the criteria and seven being as in it doesn't fit the criteria
1,Let's get guys have the yeah presentation
1,Um are done is a is we're gonna do a little opening and then um i'm gonna talk a little bit about the project The whole thing to acquaint and such a strange know each other little bit
1,Um i'm just gonna have a powerpoint presentation for us for the kick-off meeting
1,Our next meeting starts in thirty minutes
1,we're gonna do is start off with um
1,we're gonna do a little tool training so we're gonna work that whiteboard behind yeah
1,I'll draw a little
1,Pick a everything they need with that
1,Oh i should do that one i should
1,Actually train on the t. v. like you have to do one for the power the t. v. in um like
1,I haven't gotten an agenda yeah it's um i'll put that together I'm sure as well each get around instructions and then um
1,Because what we're gonna do is first are individual actions and then we'll come back together
1,I'll just attach it to you know
1,So we really need to focus in and those volumes And channel changers rather than things like the audio settings and screen settings and the channel settings because they're used much more infrequently in power which complicate
1,That's i'm gonna talk about the technical technical functions design of the remote control
1,working sanders figure out What you need to make it sell this practical function
1,And then we have to make a decision on a remote control functions i will disclose
1,I dunno we'll have our lunch break and after that we have thirty minutes of individual work
1,The parts of the working design it need to be figured out
1,We gonna have to aim for a device which is fairly conventional in design
1,i'll i'll figure that out in the meantime uh-huh
1,Okay we need to talk about our functions and our target group
1,Okay do at any other central functions that we need
1,Um we need to keep in mind the user requirement specification what needs and desires are to be fulfilled
1,We need to know what a final product is gonna be like so we need uh
1,we should remember that
1,So what we're gonna make it look pretty we need to use the colour and our slogan
1,And we also need to talk about if we're only gonna have
1,Our next meeting starts in thirty minutes a new type things you look and feel design user interface design product evaluation and you two are going to work together on a prototype using modelling clay
1,So we need to examine each element separately but we're designing awful thing see wanna keep it integrated as a whole
1,So we need to determine what the essential functions that
1,matter what we need to focus the most and fancy look-and-feel According to us
1,we should just go for pushbuttons
1,I'm not sure but i'll let you know as soon as i get any pictures
1,Essentially we need to choose
1,And of course we also have to make it look cool
1,So we need to find a way of including you somehow
1,i'll talk about the minutes from last meeting what we just discussed
1,You have to use the menu system then you have to
1,Before we need to make sure that that remote actually does
1,We're gonna need at least two special colours
1,basically in terms of making decisions what we need to do is
1,You know we also need to focus on
1,What i'll do whatever and numbers
1,So i'll make sure you do
1,We should make one that walked lights off i
1,Yeah well it is a one will discuss the trade offs in between and say uh specific instructions will be sent in your email
1,Right so i'm just gonna start this powerpoint look work
1,Use gonna believe we will go from there
1,We should we should come up with a fuzzy one as well
1,"Yeah 'cause"" i'm you we have to do all it's a like a cell phones like we have uh"""
1,a separate later um but yeah we will have to evaluate what's most important
1,Make a brief presentation that'd be great as well
1,I'll wake up okay i'll go to the back of the remote
1,Uh we need to wonder how about how we can make it better and smaller and faster um
1,this meeting will be about to be conceptual design done as peace process or conceptual design is which is something important that we need to do
1,Yeah well we should go sort out what it what and what else we're gonna talk about for the prototype a yeah that's a next step will be developing a prototype
1,We will make the touch screen in favour of voice recognition
1,Right so what are the next meeting about half an hour
1,So basically oh we're gonna do is have some presentations again master class time um in the the three you I will draw let's go first is Fine by me on the wall
1,basically we're gonna have so far see about today is um
1,And then we'll make some more decisions on um
1,I'll go first
1,And then on to the circuit board uh we're gonna use a simmons the chip
1,Well for a paper to write so we have to pick between one of the chair
1,We should hold on which you hold on to
1,It did you just saying you know we need to discuss that
1,here's our project We're gonna make a new remote control
1,Um we make a project plan and then have some time for discussion and close the meeting
1,We're gonna have to discuss the functional design first
1,You're going to think about the working design uh-huh
1,and we're going to do individual work on that and then me to
1,First were gonna start off by using our Tools
1,We're going to make this an international product market it in the states in europe in asia
1,So we'll have to figure out how to cover all the different
1,Next meeting is gonna start in thirty minutes
1,Courtney is going to do the user requirements specification
1,And you gonna get more specific instructions email to you know in just a little while
1,But they'll the role of secretary take the meeting minutes And we're gonna have three presentations one from each of you Then we're gonna discuss some new project requirements
1,And then lastly we're going to that and then it's working design How exactly will perform its functions that's the whole technical side of
1,Again which we need to replied that email and then we're gonna have lunch break and after lunch thirty minutes of individual work time
1,The target group and the functions and just different things that we need to do and then we'll close the meeting
1,so we're going to go anywhere from tends to wood all in the age range
1,And then we're going to determine the technical functions
1,and we also need to determine The specific functions of this
1,"This one and i'm gonna go back to my powerpoint 'cause"" we need to discuss the new project requirements which may very seen forced upon screen better later"""
1,Right after this meeting will be sent a questionnaire
1,And we need to promote our company more so we need to somehow include a colour and our company slogan on the remote
1,We'll come to a decision later about all the components that we need to include that um wrap up
1,A specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach
1,So do we have to include the company colour
1,To go for it we need to include the colour
1,We should make it go on that right
1,And i'll give you this
1,We should go for the lowest denominator
1,Let's go back to the be included and see what we need to do next
1,u. i. d. the user interface concept and you're going to do some trendwatching
1,And here's what we're each of us going to do the ideas going to be the look and feel design the u. i. d. the user interface design
1,We need to decide well also we can figure out how big it's gonna be like exactly what buttons we wanna and exactly
1,So we'll have to make setup make sure we produce enough of everyone
1,i'm gonna open it and i'm gonna keep the minutes as price manager when have three presentations one from each of you again
1,Yeah we have a presentation i'm going to discuss you know it's it's yeah
1,The opening we're going to have a
1,Mm case and then we're going to discuss the evaluation criteria
1,Then we're going to evaluate though
1,I'm just gonna translate
1,So we need to discuss how we feel
1,Now we're gonna talk about the project
1,We have to choose this will be control over My sitting just going to be you know actions
1,Functional design conceptual design and detailed design so Throughout our next couple of meetings will will be covering these things
1,Control should be designed
1,there's certain things we have to consider about functional aspects and conceptual design of thing
1,we're gonna do some tool training
1,It starts We have to decide to stop so
1,And come up with some new ones for the next meeting which will be in the thirty minutes
1,According to the frequency d.s and the relevant it's At each buttons i've made a list of The buttons that we should focus on in order of importance uh the most important buttons of those do with channel selection They used about c. r.s and sixty times per hour
1,Um but basically we need to make sure that it turns on off the t. v.
1,Uh we need to help me
1,and also we you need to incorporate or Corporate image on to this so
1,So we need to make some decisions and
1,Do it but i guess we should yeah make some
1,"yeah but think about it 'cause"" we need to wrap up um"""
1,We need to decide whether they should be printed so that's still has to do the material discussion should be print the Fruit stuff all should be actual remote look like a fruit
1,Take the button input and send it to the output so you have to design that each time
1,Once we come up with the design will send it to the circuit people are not just put it out
1,I'll put signal
1,Try and ask use as well that's that's
1,I mean that's another question where we're gonna we're we should have a logo somewhere
1,we should do have a sure thing for the shape like fruits there are the shape
1,We will have to fit the battery case and they're so now and i guess the
1,Yeah i like certain once you have to limit the fruit selection like you could tell it to a strawberry still
1,So you have to have a button on your on your it give to it has a button to the
1,then criteria that have to be mapped we have to use a table a chef that late it's got that's decide what the
1,I'm gonna say yes
1,Need also work together
1,Start looking at the um
1,it does this uh by well you need to start been energy source
1,yeah so i'll just a presentation on the working design
1,and so we have to decide what's gonna make our product different
1,sorry well we will do some fall so that's
1,It it will have the voice recognition
1,so as for how we should end up uh use it as a remote of a warming questions are the buttons
1,Get the voice buttons all database
1,And we've been talking about but the whole time and i'm i'm in fact kind of inclined to say that we should just Go for it
1,and the the decisions that we need to to make today you find you are
1,That we that we should look at speech recognition of the rubber of the buttons
1,Run it's a thing we need to make any uh a decision here
1,we we need to decide on the
1,Uh we should make the whole thing i don't know but uh
1,We're actually going to a place where is that um
1,That's the that's the the simplest so you all of a manufacturing and so i mention and so we will go for
1,On the wheel but we will guarantee a full of ideas
1,We're gonna have to design brief
1,Where it we will have to find a city make it a standard chip to to do this with And uh the i. b. m.
1,we we should exceed the the sales targets
1,any any slide to compromise we have to make on
1,We have to get down to the nitty gritty of
1,Um as it says we're gonna get individual instructions
1,And for we should finish this meeting that like right now one's going to of the thanks
1,And then we need uh sending mechanism to send it to the receiver
1,And i'll put some minutes of this meeting together
1,Well do some research for the next meeting
1,actually where you know we are almost a half hour out of the forty minutes so we have to get close to
1,And we'll turn to the next presentation
1,And we have to make some on decision on what functions that will have
1,And after the meeting that be the things to be done and should
1,from last meeting was the fact that we need to sell four million of these
1,Should be included
1,You still have to do the user interface
1,and each of us will get help from our coach
1,we need to come up with some specifics of the components
1,No i'm going to move on to
1,Um and we should each have a presentation to make
1,So we're going to pull the plug on me and turn this error
1,And we've therefore we have to do final questionnaire and do the meeting summary i have the final report too Present
1,As well as incorporate all of our insight into this uh evaluation exercise so i'm going to do and use the whiteboard
1,Everything is we do need to develop our technology of
1,Yep we need to say how many buttons all
1,Then for the two of you present your prototype
1,Take it into different menus course we need
1,So This means we're going to go for the priority use that were raised by uh
1,Well we will send than forty one
1,do anything that's gonna work
1,'cause i have to do an average
1,You should be handing over to your cells the design is of those uh
1,Start the first meeting
1,I'm gonna draw one partly as well
1,We'll get done this too easily
1,Aziz use and see
1,Next meeting in thirty minutes
1,"Okay 'cause"" we're going to me to the next thirty minutes"""
1,And uh we should go with few buttons than most the controls on the market
1,right so i'll do the minutes of the this meeting
1,Oh okay so i'm gonna talk a bit about the technical functions design
1,We should look inside and just get back to uh
1,We're gonna have to have to work i was gonna on these other functions as as well
1,Okay so i'll fly with the device saying you should be for the summer
1,But we have to make the decisions oh and uh
1,We need to emphasise a fancy design
1,Okay so what we should we making this number buttons
1,And then we need to make to make it easy to use this as a
1,we have to see animals elephants or whatever
1,I should come
1,Check if that's a cherry or apple do we decide against the apple because a lot of work and do we make a cherry officially
1,I've got a set of criteria just based on the marketing that we need to identify mental one as well
1,In a sense at the moment we've got a total which we need to reduce the number one point two
1,And then find it
1,We will find it now various things in
1,Shall we should reevaluate
1,And that way we need to to do it
1,So we're going for it
1,We need to
1,Um i'm going to be responsible for the functional design phase Also the conceptual design and detailed design for the final product
1,u. i. d. the technical functions design will will be worked on the next thirty minutes um
1,i'll be doing some trendwatching in the conceptual design And product evaluation
1,There's one thing that we're going to be doing today um
1,Our next meeting will be in half an hour said half an hour to uh
1,We need the user requirements from the man it
1,you will get specific instructions
1,Um of what to do the next half an hour and i'll see you in half an hour okay
1,Um we have to decide on a target group And the functions of the remote control so
1,That's probably feasible so you did we should do the lighting up thing and the glow in the dark being and the shape of the numbers that are kind of decide what we're gonna do with this
1,And we should also be looking to trends in clothing and interior design a just an electronic fashion so that it's something that fits in the household
1,You know we should discuss some those other options that you product genevieve
1,Um we should be looking towards trends in both closing in interior design
1,So we need to think about how we could bring this in um
1,Um so we'll have to investigate How much that will cost us cost the company
1,"Um 'cause"" it sounds very labour intensive we have to hire number of people And they might be more expense of"""
1,Alright also have to investigate the financial implications
1,So now we need to discuss
1,Because we need to investigate the financial implications
1,Let's have lunch in will discuss a slide or
1,will reconvene in thirty minutes It back
1,We need to start making some more specific decisions
1,I'm just gonna receive it interface concept of he's nine
1,What we're gonna do a break the cost of buttons functions course and forms and that and
1,Okay so we have to decide now exactly what we are going to do
1,do we have to make some
1,We'll all once again have poppy is our first present to
1,and i will switch at
1,Um that doesn't improve to use the product product so we need to come up with something and
1,Your personal coach will To the rest of the information for it's a
1,don't forget to complete final questionnaire and meeting summary
1,Yeah i'm gonna check that out for sake yeah
1,I'm gonna open up the second one then
1,So we need to tell yep how much i will are our product will be costly
1,Um detailed design phase i'll be doing product evaluation
1,And so i'll be Collecting the requirements of the ranking all the requirements to see how we did
1,We'll make it
1,Meeting that we should focus on and tell then it's probably deciding on a certain
1,Uh we need to simplify the remote and reduce the number of buttons get rid of the ones
1,But you you should put it back in
1,So gorgeous and i'll draw on some other things
1,i i'm going to do a lot of the stuff on the board um
1,So i'm going to explain that's on the board other
1,We need to use
1,Work on our individual work
1,I'll do the minutes
1,well we need to finish up here um
1,Manual you're going to work on the components For for what we're gonna use let's go with Are are up
1,I'll see you a in a
1,and then for the user interface concept we need to decide what the tape what
1,We need to make clear in the design
1,For components concept we need to come up with the energy source um
1,we decided that are we know that we need to use company colours company logo
1,Then each of you will have your presentation
1,and then we will need to make a decision on
1,And that we should also focus on
1,Um as we've already said we need to focus on a fancy look-and-feel
1,it's getting and we'll do
1,I have one big objection and that is that we have to fit an l. c. d.
1,i'm gonna plug in here real quick
1,so these are the decisions that we do need to make by the end of this meeting
1,so we will have another meeting in thirty minutes
1,Complete final questionnaire and meeting summary
1,I'll go ahead and go through the minutes from the previous meeting
1,I still have to do my minutes for this meeting i
1,We need to decide if we solve the problem of the users to complain about them ugly remote
1,Then we'll go to the finance and see if we fall within the budget
1,Then we'll do the evaluation and then we can finish about for that
1,You guys are gonna how we do it in the evaluation of the criteria
1,And then we'll do a group of valuation the prototype
1,We're gonna be doing it based on a seven point scale
1,And then we'll have to check with beep Main boss whether we can
1,We're gonna see you get individual offices
1,So for the reading room we will have
1,We should leave a space for that it's
1,Because and you have to find the yeah you have to find somebody agreed to come with you
1,I should start start making full sentences
1,Here should Have a smaller office
1,We'll see make sure you label you boxes properly
1,Well make a mailing lists
1,I don't know if we need to sort of those that's where they're gonna plug everything
1,You have time to to go and think about it are ask the people you know your assistants for instance and at the next meeting will try to
1,We're going to get more space so that's a very good piece of years
1,the other group will also propose a solution and then there will be another negotiation so
1,i will try to find this out for the next time
1,Oh so it's it's yeah you have a copy susan need to david i think
1,yeah we'll try to find out
1,Next tuesday we have a meeting yeah
1,So i mean i think that we should still check with them
1,We will be
1,You will change
1,Yeah they will promote that
1,No i should look now at the the
1,Out of courtesy we should first ask yeah
1,Well make a final decision actually probably a pre final one since we all have to check again with everyone
1,All the furniture from the previous lounge will will bring it here
1,Yeah what will just review the items to see if we look at all the constraints and then you'll be able to say the final uh
1,And we'll find some way too
1,The for the the printer to be there yeah i think it's it's feasible will will check
1,you will explain to your visitors that
1,Oh well let me put the plans already i will display yeah
1,No that's what they're gonna put amount of
1,Leave it will go to the to the computer room
1,Yeah i will have to check that
1,Yeah i'll try i'll bring my walkman and ah
1,As we should you have a stream
1,You should the circulated uh all the mail
1,yeah i'll circulate it's perfect
1,Uh you will have
1,We'll get them activated yeah
1,You will receive some information about that
1,i will obviously be going to do some people who only work part time or some people are doing p. h. d.s are master students don't necessarily be there for a large extent of time So for example you lean uh and to finish my and our master students For right now so whether they decide to stay in j. p. h. d.
1,Have to redo strict from our eighty percent or fifty percent that's probably something
1,Yeah we'll go about some of the constraints and well first of all i must say that
1,Research students really know we'll finish our master the users so it's
1,this she is in italics you will arrive in about two months
1,Yes you have to work later
1,So now let's vote should we vote just for one film or should each of us say give
1,Three of us to do it and shiny keep track of how do you have a sixteen
1,So i don't think basically two extremes i will take schindler's list and i will take at the big label ski
1,right i will present your three these different design we'll discuss it so first we have to decide for a um
1,We still have to decide for next meeting and we all all set
1,So we have to redo the poster or so
1,I i have some people in the in the theatres think all now we have to see it again
1,Yeah should we have to work
1,I have some paper have to use
1,Okay i'll try to do something but first anyway we have to select a movie
1,We will interested in uh
1,should be picked a
1,Do we do have to keep you have to to provide something that is of course some money
1,uh we need to remove the cash for this we do and this is a
1,We need to remove them
1,And i'll use uh
1,We should take yeah that
1,Sure that we should look and see
1,So that they should net and sees about the the um
1,Reanimate yeah i need to use than on windows
1,But you said you need to do some segmentation option on top of the
1,You need to get made a impede these were the effects of there
1,To what other experiments we need to do
1,And then you have to get the b. b. l. p. features and
1,And then we we need to train the new
1,So it should be replaced by e
1,You have to do your credit card number and
1,You have to deal with this up to the
1,You have to go building and uh
1,But but you still need to down on the next one
1,You do you need to use all the net uh months Beep beep confirmation then
1,You have to look at the effect on on the right and the evaluation task
1,Two things in a syntactic we are going to be linked
1,We need share use a should not
1,So you you should first train the were p. s. a. stuff
1,And they begin to say okay and and have to divide eating five group
1,It's so joe is going to talk
1,I'm going to listen
1,This problem but still need we need to continue on this
1,So we will send you the papers real eighty eight
1,And i will point to to all the court
1,So you will get another value of bandwidth for people who speak
1,spoken seventy personnel that i mean the five last minutes Obviously we need to up to know that it's the same people so like now I'll practical solution is to have a
1,You have to test basically
1,But we will make it because uh
1,I don't know we'll we'll we will try out
1,So you should all move a rap
1,So you should be with location or you can do is extract segments Of speech for example
1,No no it you should separate then fast yeah
1,We need separate
1,You have to go it's uh
1,Ten people should sit down read the papers
1,Simple and then it's So then you will have a g. do too
1,That yeah they have to do some testing that nasa there's some speech recognition test
1,Every paper and then we should contain all the results from the installation or something on the task
1,Yeah so we are going to talk about the papers mean the speech yeah
1,You should try i don't know
1,Uh elation should be done automation and then course used to use an i. d.
1,Mm and because you have to do it separately for h.
1,Uh it should be thirteen in december
1,And then you have to do m. o. s. so um
1,You need to follow all those
1,So it doesn't greek right it it small testing it doesn't require so for this week i mean you should put it will got on the computer you could do tool then you you basically use a play on the ball size and you look where they're at the end you have uh
1,See in our case we need to look what processing of slacks that in our case it needs to transcribe with an l. c. r. and then making fixing we need to have a high resolution image I guess that's what you mean by a procedure
1,I should check
1,Have to do the the the amy recognition system that we have now is either for these microphones all for the microphone alright
1,Alright but first we will do some uh tool training
1,So next meeting will be in uh in thirty minutes in
1,Yeah we have to add trailers from five euros
1,Um and then it's got demographic write down
1,Because it down many numbers and we need to select the constraint
1,it's the it's going to do it it's not going to be see so easy but
1,That it's going to do that so for me
1,We need to really need to interest uh it
1,Yeah because we have to take into account that well then i'm aware gonna sell it uh fall a lot our um for me and
1,The next meeting will uh after lunch you have
1,three minutes of work and then we have the next meeting
1,But let's say next meeting will be produced two designs
1,Yeah that yeah next meeting we should do it
1,And further instructions will be uh will be sent to where yeah but you know
1,Two cats number buttons we have to make a seven to to fit in twelve twelve fifty
1,i will buy
1,Yeah so and and then you get feedback fide l. c. d.
1,Or we just have to choose and adapt
1,We have to make it more attractive And which one which too big for this one we have to make more cheap
1,Should go for the advanced chip
1,Yeah we have to ask look uh stuff that's the design two d. uh in the she i dunno designer
1,We will have to design it
1,So uh then i will ask the user and if i interface designer
1,Try to find out what are the the absolute requirement with these absolutely need it you know remote control
1,You have to buy and that's as a
1,Uh send me your presentation before by email or
1,Find it's
1,Yeah but then you have to you have to define the buttons to serve
1,i will take notes during this meeting so
1,Finish tonight
1,Yeah and We just have to define the processing power that we need
1,What oh so we have to decide the so it should be lighting in the dark
1,So i will we we move to the next meeting so in
1,You just need to put their channel numbers Somewhere bit out of the way
1,To have to be done before the next meeting
1,We have to make it look
1,So we have to take from d. c. and then there's the spec so
1,yeah we'll first present but we are going to do in this meeting
1,Yeah we have to do it
1,For for design i'm gonna i'm gonna try to market a a much higher price i need to make it special with a high price tag
1,It's possible twenty five euros a selling price We really have to innovate yeah i guess
1,the interface design and uh i will change the colours and uh
1,Two two people who are gonna buy consumer electronics
1,We we have to wait for you get to a more specific design phase for that
1,Yeah we we need to i mean have a few designs to look at and then come up with something
1,It's a do you have to do it in the box
1,Really need to wrap
1,But you guys are the ones that have to ultimately create a product within cost
1,So do we need to retrain mic on how to put is mike on
1,I'm gonna take some knocks
1,Got forty minutes to do this and we should be
1,Six and then she should go with that but still
1,uh the u. functional design you have to do on any individual work
1,You will have to work on the design and also
1,Space you have to design it's and you have to take care of thing
1,oh and the next meeting will start in thirty minutes
1,Yeah i'm just gonna i'm trying to give you some trends about what should be done um
1,So the next meeting will start in thirty meeting minutes so
1,So you will have to work on be look-and-feel design
1,Yeah we we we have to do Adapt to use it to
1,We should I'll copy this new technology
1,We have to take to to have a first kick-off meeting about to use your project going to try to talk about to a few minutes
1,In which direction we should go so we need to close the meeting
1,You have to work on the on the working design
1,You have to uh work on the technical functions
1,We're going to have a second meeting oh my god
1,Report be back next meeting
1,You have to find it with missus um
1,So then you have this you know you have to train models for
1,Okay we should we should discuss this later after after after this this it's like
1,so you have to work on the components
1,You have to uh what can the look-and-feel uh design and you have to work on the user interface in fact you do you have to work together
1,So that they need training we have to work to do was to go to move forward
1,Make dealer well to make a banana
1,where are trendy doing she's meeting to start a new project which is about designing their remote control
1,So i'm going to be is the project manager of these the project
1,My name is how make it how about and uh i'm going to be interface designer
1,So it's more like well going to do in the in t. v. do or walk
1,I have to inform you are you receive an email from the management button board today
1,'cause you can still do it
1,It's that mean we should use the court all of our company
1,We must use additional source of energy
1,The goal of this meeting is to reach a decision
1,We're going to meet again in thirty minutes
1,Your personal coach will send you some instruction or
1,And of course they u. i. d. you mark will be uh focused on the user interface concept
1,so we will have the next meeting in thirty minutes again
1,So i'll see you in thirty minutes
1,I'll buy it
1,After this meeting will propose The party for or sex as for the
1,We have to decide this
1,Need to collect information
1,Yeah we should discuss it in the next meeting or
1,Well you have to make it work
1,Yeah we should also optimise be the number of
1,Please number and draw uh
1,Discuss it in the next meeting
1,You have to create a vocabulary
1,as always going to change the batteries of the remote control so we have someone charger there
1,We need to have the you say good morning coffee machine in the mission reply to you
1,You will be sent to say they i'm here
1,We have you should find a material that is robust in the same time spongy
1,Oh no we have to ask this question
1,We have to You guys ones hum
1,and please please copy all the main sort all the discussions to me okay so i need to submit to the management
1,Which mind and at the conclusion of our meeting could you could you send us a copy of your slides
1,Give me some kind of our project plan okay discuss and it's uh
1,We'll have to see how through discussion and we're gonna go from here from with us
1,So in terms of the functionalities that we need obviously need to be able to turn the t. v. on and off you need to change channels But by directly going to a specific channel or by channel surfing You need to build to control the volume and then control any menus on the t. v.
1,It's actual speech so then you have to make sure that the speech recogniser is good enough The filter out the t. v. speech
1,But end of the day you all those sales guys so i will come i can sit on your hard because uh you're going to do your cells projection okay
1,and specific instructions will be sent by our our coach
1,And the shooting for that and uh i will invite the the christian and eighty eight and uh agnes to discuss the board on the various subjects
1,Okay with our ideas and uh then we will come back again and uh the next week
1,I'll do that so thanks
1,And uh i'll send you the the minutes of mate
1,And then since we talked about using some sort of speech recognition have to have mike from all made an extra hum have to have mike found in the device
1,And we have to take a decision on the remote control
1,And finally in this meeting we have to decide
1,I don't know but i'll find out more our next meeting
1,'cause we have to find that cost
1,So by next meeting so place come up with the the prototype
1,Aw should do some market tests uh
1,So that uh i will look off to i will speak to the management and how to get to you know some more uh
1,We will introduce me this more than and uh let's introduce in the market and let's take the feedback from the customers then
1,Yeah design should be yeah it should be different all that almost all the remotes
1,the next meeting will be in thirty minutes i think you all do you get the notes is on your computer for this okay so will you got a note is um
1,Um we get means each of us will get instructions and we'll take it from there
1,I'm going to draw three
1,We should put on those things that i have to try to sell it
1,And i'll i'll of course they should be a key is very became Keep all the things and you know different shapes or whatever it is it should be used
1,So these are two things we should come up with with
1,We don't have a lot of time left and we will still have to make a decision and the marketing expert has to present for
1,You will receive specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches
1,Oh next meeting will be in thirty minutes and it be
1,So we should address that
1,I'm supposed to make a little presentation um mm
1,I'll go away
1,So we have to get input from most people
1,I'll get three
1,So that's an and basically i need to send him an overview of the problem kind of a short summary of the different
1,We need to send you to just talk on your own when we have no idea what we were trying to make is
1,So you were was a question is you have to travel these times because you're gonna be spending a lot of time
1,what i'm gonna do is identify the schedule paris and the meeting at like
1,Right we should talk to competing people
1,It will be a lot of work going on monday
1,We need to solve that problem for them i see i mean we
1,And you need to do that yeah
1,Uh so it's still but we we have to go to all day
1,industrial designer is going to work on the working design
1,So we have to work together to reach our aims
1,We're going to work with a lot of high tech tools here
1,then i'll put the minutes from this meeting in the project folder
1,I'm just gonna draw its uh i have to
1,I will put the minutes from this meeting uh
1,Uh i will put the minutes in the project uh project documents folder
1,Make very few buttons
1,So now for the next meeting um we'll have to look That's the look-and-feel design this report that the corporate design image
1,So it's do it just up to the design department what we're gonna use
1,Make a good design for all the
1,Uh we're going to discuss today
1,Mm i don't have any information on pricing so i'll have to ask him infection department
1,The usability interface design and we'll do the product evaluation
1,Then we'll do the project uh evaluation
1,And this meeting we'll discuss our final
1,And there are going to a close the project today as well
1,Just make a real simple
1,We have to cut costs
1,So we're gonna have to do a lotta convincing them
1,You have to test it somewhere
1,Then we have to do the three
1,It's very important we have to look what the needs artifact of the functional design
1,Gonna make a remote control
1,We have to look what uh the market is doing
1,and uh we have to make a profit of fifty million euros so we have to uh use a big marketing euro
1,For the next and you have to uh put it exactly on the square
1,we're going to make uh
1,well we have to make something uh
1,They have uh an of thirty minutes so then we going to
1,Uh it's producing the pattern so we have to make a chip that could use the spectrum stew
1,So that we have to make as a as a bit more intelligent chip then the standard one because
1,Uh that's a lot so we have to make a beautiful remote control
1,Uh basically what you have to do is
1,Uh i'll start
1,Is like a a imac or something you should make it
1,So we have to uh
1,And you have to
1,So you have to indicate that is
1,We have to give our customers some extras
1,You have to do a lot of testing before we can do that
1,Yeah we have to put our real reaction logo as well on the
1,So we have to make a decision what kind of form is gonna have to come to
1,So we're going to talk about the conceptual mono
1,We have to discuss about it so it's Mm
1,that's yeah how are you gonna make it
1,I'll check what it looks to me
1,"No uh we were gonna make many of those so we can start a mass production and then 'cause"" we're still will be"""
1,We have to decide on that
1,I'll i'll give you my design
1,So we need to uh
1,But we have to do something about trends
1,So we should do that here
1,okay i'll i'll take a look
1,Yeah we have to go to to draw uh looked really new one because uh we still um
1,To have to design that know as well
1,He said it then yeah he will draw here
1,And we we have to build in a microphone and
1,You going to show your prototype presentation of me
1,Yeah this so we have to design inside and that it should be uh
1,no yeah we're gonna use an advanced chips or
1,I'll give comments
1,We're going to do that
1,So uh we will do we need to fix that or
1,we have to discuss it
1,I'll give it to
1,Now we should test it but uh
1,We have to have a look at this one here the production cost of it
1,We have to say about that
1,Marketing said things and then we have to include them in the design
1,You'd have to make a choice
1,You have to do so i'll uh
1,The marketing expert will uh will take a look at the user requirement specification the user interface designer will work out the technical functions design And that was the interface designer
1,Namely the functional design conceptual design and detailed design as you can see all these faces consists of two parts namely individual work part and a meeting where we will discuss uh
1,Well take a look at the project plan uh they will be time for discussion actually we have to discuss because we have to
1,No the industrial designer will take a look at the working design any in a usability interaction
1,our next meeting uh we'll start will work with with early but our next meeting will start in in thirty minutes
1,Um and that's what you only for our first excise because i'm uh going to ask you to draw your favourite animal
1,mm the most functions uh we will use will be to to add a new page
1,than uh will buy the remote control because well because of the first they lost all of the los first one
1,in the email you will receive uh shortly i hope
1,Uh will take a look at uh the working design
1,But you should make sure that you have every button they need one
1,Yeah but then you have to choose the this is always with a universal remotes have to choose the code
1,well i will tell you for on what
1,Create a product
1,And then we will close this session
1,Blank one i will do it as well because we and use that
1,Sure we should take an acceleration
1,A set of the previous meeting And uh also put these as fast as possible in the uh project folder so you can see them We few what we've have discussed
1,if you haven't heard about them yet And and of course we have to take a decision on the remote control functions
1,Only thing you have to do was what the screen of one since time
1,Make it available in different colours sure
1,Right you should you throw them all in one well So options
1,Well you should you should to adjust of thing
1,We should focus on an l. c. d. screen
1,and this is what we're going to do
1,It should be done in there should be there
1,Um we're going to use a docking station
1,We have to search for it
1,And of course specific instructions will be sent to you again by your personal coach
1,the next meeting is once again in thirty minutes um here are the individual actions and especially
1,And then you should get the other options that were to what you could do and that's you could do with
1,So we have to decide
1,once again i will try to oh right to make switch it just
1,And uh i will buy uh
1,We'll go next
1,I'm going to do something about trend watching
1,Will work together and do we have to stay here and way
1,Yeah but it's a special colour and just rubber colour You have to add something to the rubber to make great
1,Process have a menu second have a meeting uh for Several weeks
1,and then we're going to the project or Product evaluation we just did our project evaluation
1,and uh please put it in the project folder
1,Yeah i will also curve
1,But we need to draw a little bit to get a good uh uh
1,I will put back on the
1,i'm still going to take some minutes
1,And uh then we have to look at something which is less nice
1,I'm gonna works
1,Yeah i'll have to rate Is is have a snuff true is one
1,We should do that
1,Okay so we have to
1,We're going to do it i
1,But you have to fill in
1,well i do i have any any I'll do that because i draw the uh
1,Yeah we need to uh
1,you should You should drop the speech recognition
1,Yeah we should do we have we have to make this like four or five or something It's very nice
1,I'll move on to
1,I'll make a a v. h. s.
1,Each of you can uh take some practice and you should draw an animal
1,And at the end of today we should have uh a prototype
1,You should take some practice have some instructions not to do that
1,i will give it and uh and hi
1,he should get started
1,You do some individual work you have a meeting individual work meeting at the end of the you have to find a meeting Then i have to prepare
1,And we have to decide on the functions and on the
1,We should use use an uh not phones option
1,Well we have to keep all the classic functions or make the buttons as user-friendly as possible
1,And i'm going to make a a nice menu uh
1,I'm gonna talk about functional requirements
1,So we have to make uh a compromise between functionality of fashionable fashion that
1,Okay you you you you are going to make a list of what functions are uh
1,Thank you have to change your desktop uh
1,We have to start of either way
1,Find your office
1,I will buy it
1,I'd i'm going to make
1,We have to ask
1,And i will try to the first we have a line is very no
1,Factors involved in choosing the components there's a lot of options that we have to discuss
1,The the display we will put in here the basic functions and here Where it's most reachable
1,"But we will have to go for the double curved 'cause"" it's tearing and different from what we have now"""
1,You two are going to work on smart board next thirty minutes to design something so
1,Yeah you're going to design it
1,I'll just put it
1,i will address and uh
1,So because we need to sell it for twenty five euro a piece that's gonna be difficult huh
1,We should use
1,That's how we are going to make it a more trendy
1,Uh partly but you have to bring on the number
1,You will do the evaluation
1,You will do it
1,Send it to me
1,The going to do this
1,"It's silly 'cause"" we we should have at this meeting before we start drawing"""
1,We'll have to go for single curve some money we have to drop on everything
1,Titans we have to draw
1,I'll start with the costs because that's costing to influence our design
1,Three buttons from here we still have to make some adjustments Round here
1,So we have to to make it's more that has to be
1,well They're in a word document which i will open now
1,We all have to uh
1,Yeah well we have to evaluate i guess what we have now
1,I will make it a morse code
1,I will go for one
1,yeah we're gonna go for two
1,I have to do is turn around
1,yeah we have to count them
1,you have to
1,You have to do a product evaluation on that
1,well we have to delete an l. c.
1,"I will take this work 'cause"" it looks"""
1,But after after after these five minutes you have to
1,Uh yeah we have to do the project uh evaluation Just to do that quickly
1,The others have to make
1,I'll do that and drawings um
1,Uh first a little opening uh i will introduce myself uh
1,I mean you have to exercise
1,You have to scroll uh
1,It will do
1,finish think that's an are we going further
1,i agree with you so we must focus on things will really uh
1,You have to do something special
1,next meeting will start in thirty minutes so uh
1,Make some mark up some
1,And then in and next meeting we decide
1,And uh and then are we going to uh fit uh
1,I will uh take minutes and we'll put uh
1,Which i will show you
1,i will tell something about the
1,These things are all the nice i'll show it to you in an uh
1,a few seconds and i'll explain and it's about uh how it works and how we could
1,i'll i'll just explain a bit of the components
1,Well we have to look at what's our target
1,A lot of time Into programming because you will have to start working with profiles and such
1,We have to reconsider the speech function
1,At the end uh i will take notes uh
1,I am going to draw right
1,you you will be keeping busy with the project uh evaluation but the most uh specific instructions will be sent to you by email
1,So we're going to work together right now
1,Instructions that you will work together
1,So we're going to evaluate the design according to the parts user requirements and trends analysis
1,that you have to put uh
1,we're going to do that with a seven point scale
1,We're going to vote we yeah the prototype
1,yeah oh they have to do this
1,We also have to compare it to the uh
1,we have to fill in the numbers
1,They will finish in this first and then the back
1,Yeah so we have to break the back back flat same as
1,I'm gonna save it
1,Yeah and should try to run twice a name
1,square You have to draw it yourself know
1,We'll just make a link in
1,And that one or two things you have to draw way or they are just use of the board
1,Management expert you have to change yeah
1,I'm going to finish my aunt report
1,Uh every participant should draw its favourite animal and some of its favourite characteristics
1,I'm gonna make some minutes to take some minutes
1,I'll tell us something about the your favourite characteristics of this uh particular birds
1,One thing you have to place and i thought Exactly on the
1,You will receive an email with the example of a explanation of what uh
1,Well i'm gonna draw um
1,Specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach
1,Normally linked to the remote control I think it's very import because we gonna make such a basic Remote control we have to do something to make it special it's gonna cost twenty five euros
1,We have to zap buttons the volume should we do we make them very big the the the said button that is
1,It's lunch break and then we have thirty minutes of individual work
1,We've got three presentations and i'm gonna show you some of the new project requirements that were sent to me
1,So we should Put uh zap buttons on it um
1,We also need the other thing you use used to we we we have to choose for the the simple design i guess
1,Well then we i'm gonna show you some of the new project requirements and we gonna discuss and uh
1,distinction between this time for most we should we should choose one though we should not compromise but we choose for uh expert few or no first
1,We should make it to uh
1,uh you will have to look that up
1,Should focus on the t. c. then
1,Well we have to wear that's uh
1,will need to bring out line of t. v.s which we were planning to but whatever Because A t. v. has to send information back to the r. c.
1,I'll again be the secretary make minutes
1,I'll make one in the next uh twenty minutes
1,We have to bring their logo and all that stuff uh
1,Yes because we have to uh
1,it's uh of course will read discuss it on those sides
1,But we yeah we have to um
1,We we have to use
1,Okay but what what are are the test technical things we have to discuss
1,I'm going to do or bulky
1,I'll put uh i will put a price on it
1,Find it in your in your right now and we note
1,Yeah we'll find out what's impressive
1,We we don't use to do now i'm gonna make the docking station then we still
1,So we're gonna use a simple chip
1,I'm gonna open the specially them all gonna work this out together because
1,We will look at all the special stuff we have
1,Are i've got it I will put uh
1,Yeah but we have we have to talk about the light so
1,And then we have to adjust the two buttons we place them in the middle uh
1,Again i'm gonna
1,Uh we're gonna have a prototype presentation first
1,Uhuh was gonna give a prototype presentation
1,The next day you're gonna give a presentation to uh to see the
1,i will make it a three because uh
1,But that's that's that's are we we need we include One battery that i'll explain it's it the the components are listed over here the price is given
1,We should know how many
1,Yeah we just have to go all what we do today it again
1,So every time we will do some individual work get meeting talk about it
1,Uh remote and you will look into that technical design and um
1,Next meeting is in
1,The people of often the like bright colours or something we have to make grey of all black
1,I'll i'll show you the
1,We'll discuss about our first ideas about the project
1,and then I'm going to the next phase
1,Shall this you have to
1,You have to push harder
1,Calculate how much we have to sell
1,we're gonna Produce
1,Our remote control functions we have to be we have to decide in this meeting
1,So we have to decide on the different remote control functions
1,I think you should put more time in the in the design of uh
1,"Right that we have to make a decision now 'cause"" we don't have much time um"""
1,when they pick up the remote know that we have to do that
1,We have to merge the strong points from our competitors
1,We should make it uh compare with a new d. v. d. and all really she's we
1,Well we have to do with the materials uh well should be hard plastic with rubber from that ties
1,No the new project requirements i'll just show them I got this mail
1,But we have to uh change the that's the two that's uh
1,But we have to reject that Because it going
1,No well we we we still need to know how much that will cost
1,We should have a general idea of how it's gonna look
1,We'll draw too
1,But you will have to make consensus with ties uh
1,We're still have to make uh the the real basic design because uh we have the I guess but
1,Well i will drawl what i have drawn on the screen
1,But uh we should decide now
1,Uh we have to decide all this thing
1,Right i'm going to tell you something about the components design
1,We we do it will just give them and uh will design it and they they can give comments on that
1,We have to design now together the
1,So we have to uh put it in one and document uh
1,No no no no you have to make this titanium to
1,Um well i'll start with the presentation again
1,I'll show them
